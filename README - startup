Welcome to the repeatable pentest.



--------------------First Time Setup------------------------------
If you freshly downloaded this "tool" please make sure you unzip de
hoppenbrouwerscustom.zip in Resources/passwordCrack as this is the
default cracklist to check for weak passwords that have to do with
the company itself.
Make sure you have installed the following:
Mentalist:
https://github.com/sc0tfree/mentalist
Hydra:
https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/hydra
Nikto:

------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------The Scripts-----------------------------------
You have 2 options of running the scripts. You can run the main
script that will go over all the options and will run everything.
The other option is running the python scripts individually.

You can run the main script by opening the kali linux terminal
and type "python3 mainScript.py"

to run a individual script replace the mainScript.py with the
script you want to use (example: python3 NetworkScanner.py 0)
